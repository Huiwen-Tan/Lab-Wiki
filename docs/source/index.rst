Having Questions?
-----------------

Here is a general approach you should adopt when facing problems (especially important for PhD students):

1. Try to solve yourself by looking for answers online. These habits will help you to build problem solving and independent learning skills.
   This is much easier nowadays with AI tools, e.g. debugging codes can be much faster now instead of reading through many StackExchange answers which may not always be the same problem.

2. Try to consult other group members. Everyone here comes from diverse backgrounds and will very likely know something that others don’t.

3. If really cannot solve after exhausting all options then ask PI. By then, you'll probably have a clearer idea of what the issue really is, and that’ll make the discussion much more efficient.
